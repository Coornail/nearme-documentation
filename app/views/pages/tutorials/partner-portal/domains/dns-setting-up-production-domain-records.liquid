This guide will help you add DNS Records to your DNS Zone hosted as DNS Zone.

## Requirements
To be able to add DNS records you have to first [create](/tutorials/partner-portal/domains/production-domain) and [configure](/tutorials/partner-portal/domains/production-domain-pos) Domain as DNS Zone.

## Steps
#### Note: that we are improving this function UX constantly trying to make it as user friendly as possible. Some diferences/changes may apply

Once your domain has been properly configured then the domain View page will display all DNS records which were created in the Zone.

If you want to add a new record please follow the steps:
- click `Add additional record` button
- type name of the record - it should just a name without the root domain. Leave the field empty if you want a name as the root domain. [rephrase it]
- select DNS record type - on right side of the form help section should update and provide additional information about the selected type. Follow the instruction.
- set TTL (value in seconds).
<small>TTL (Time to Live) is a setting for each DNS record that specifies how long a resolver is supposed to cache (or remember) the DNS query before the query expires and a new one needs to be done.
For records that rarely change, such as TXT or MX records, itâ€™s best to keep those somewhere between an hour (3600) and a day (86400)</small>
- add value for your record. Refer to the help for possible requirements on formatting.

Note. You can add many records at once.

Important. When edition if finished you have to click `Commit DNS changes` button. It will take a few minutes to apply changes to the DNS system. Although DNS propagation might take a bit longer.
