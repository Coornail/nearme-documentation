This guide will help you set up a production domain. The production domain is the domain of your production Instance, your live site available to visitors.


## Requirements
To be able to set up a production domain on the Partner Portal, you have to have access to the Partner Portal, have a production Instance, and you should be familiar with the recommended development workflow.

* [Accessing the Partner Portal](/get-started/accessing-partner-portal)
* [Setting Up a Site on Our Platform](/get-started/setting-up-site)
* [Development Workflow](/how-platformos-works/platformos-workflow/development-workflow)

#### Note: Domain can be added only in a production data center. It means you cannot setup additional domain on staging data centers.
#### Note: that we are improving this function UX constantly trying to make it as user friendly as possible. Some diferences/changes may occur/apply
## Steps

On the selected Instance's page, click on `Domains` then `Add new domain to your instance`.

The next step is to decide how you will manage the DNS records. In the end, both scenarios will include creating a www version of your domain and redirecting from the root to the www version.
Pick an option from below:

* Route53 Hosted Zone [Recommended]
Choose this option if you want to manage the DNS through the Partner Portal by creating a Route53 Hosted Zone. You can fully configure your domain, add any necessary DNS records, add MX records for mail boxes, etc all here.

* External DNS management
Choose this option if you want to manage the DNS through a 3rd party solution. After confirming right to your domain, you will be provided a Load Balancer DNS Name [FQDN] to which you will need to point your domain, within your 3rd party solution.
*NOTE*: your DNS solution must provide for the acceptance of Fully Qualified Domain Names!

After selecting your option you will have to enter the name of the new domain and click on `Create domain`.
Note: It must be a root domain, example: platformos-demo.com, not www.domain.com.

You will be redirected back to the domains page. After a few moment, your new domain will appear on the domain list. Wait for status to change from pending and then click `view` for futher instruction.
