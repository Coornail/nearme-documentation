This guide will help you set up a production domain. The production domain is the domain of your production Instance, your live site available to visitors.

## Requirements
To be able to set up a production domain within 3rd Party Provider, you have to [Create Domain with External DNS management](/tutorials/partner-portal/domains/production-domain) first.

#### Note: that we are improving this function UX constantly trying to make it as user friendly as possible. Some diferences/changes may apply
## Steps
### Ownership verification
As a next step you will be asked to demonstrate control over the domain. You will do this by adding at least one CNAME record to your current DNS Zone.

Visit the domain list page, find your domain and click the `view` link. The page will display a requested CNAME record[s].

Visit your DNS provider Control Panel add the presented CNAME record. For more information please refer to your DNS provider .

It can take a few minutes for the changes to propagate. The page will refresh automatically every few minutes. If not you can refresh the page manually.

#### Diagnostics
You can observe propagation status on the last column of CNAME record table. If the status changes to `OK` then the change has been propagated to Cloudflare DNS system.
Please note that diagnostics are only informational. DNS propagation can take up to 24h in the worst scenario. Usualy it's not longer than 1 hour.

When status is OK the page should refresh automatically and display `Congratulations! Your Domain is Ready` message.
If not, please click `OK. Done. I added requested record` button.
If you are shown the same page again it means the propagation did not accomplish yet. Please try again in a few minutes.

#### When propagation went well you will see 'Configuration! Your Domain is Ready' message.

### Final configuration
There are only two steps ahead:

Please go to your DNS provider Control Panel:
1. setup forwarding to a presented DNS name. [screenshot]
Accordingly to your DNS provider - it will be an ANAME record or an ALIAS. Refer to your DNS provider docs for furter instructions.
2. add www CNAME record

Note. It can take a few minutes for the changes to propagate.

#### Troubleshooting
In case of issue you can visit `diagnostics` link.
There are two textareas which should display the same values when domain propagation is accomplished and correct. [describe it better]

### That's all. Your configuration is finished.
