This guide will help you set up a production domain. The production domain is the domain of your production Instance, your live site available to visitors.

## Requirements
To be able to set up a production domain on the Partner Portal, you have to [Create Domain as DNS Zone](/tutorials/partner-portal/domains/production-domain) first,

## Steps
#### Note: that we are improving this function UX constantly trying to make it as user friendly as possible. Some diferences/changes may apply

Your domain configuration will be hosted in DNS Zone and [can be managed](/tutorials/partner-portal/domains/production-domain-dns-records) either through Partner Portal [or through PP API].

You have to reconfigure you domain in your current domain provider. It requires simply changing Name Servers to the addresses provided on the View page.

Please refer to your DNS provider for more information.

It can take a few minutes for the changes to propagate. You can optionally click `diagnostics` link and check if the change has been propagated to Cloudflare DNS system.
Please note that diagnostics are only for informational purpose and might help diagnose problems. DNS propagation might take up to 24h in the worst scenario. Usualy it's not longer than 1 hour.

The page will refresh automatically every few minutes. If not you can force the page reloading by clicking the `I have changed Name Servers` button.

When propagation went well you will see message that your domain is ready. You instance should be accessible from the domain you just set up from now on.

## What else
You can [add DNS records to your domain](/tutorials/partner-portal/domains/production-domain-dns-records) now.
