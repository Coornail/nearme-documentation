<h4 class="release-note release-note__new">NEW</h4>

* `pos-cli`: the old `marketplace-kit` has been forked into a new package - [pos-cli](/get-started/installing-pos-cli). From now on `marketplace-kit` is in archive mode and will no longer be developed.
* `form_submit` mutation was added to GraphQL: This new mutation will trigger a form submission along with invoking authorization policies and validation. It accepts two parameters: `form_configuration_name` and `params`. This way, you will be able to easily validate any user parameters against a given form configuration and persist it if valid. Most useful for creating API endpoints which re-use existing form configurations.
* Added the possibility to fetch related `users` for the `models` GraphQL query - [Model](api-reference/graphql/objects#model)

<h4 class="release-note release-note__improved">IMPROVED</h4>

* `pos-cli`: the `gui serve` will return a user friendly message if the port is already taken.
* `pos-cli`: the `audit` command will be automatically run during `deploy`; its performance has been greatly improved.
* Redesigned emails for modules in Partner Portal
* Renamed Customization to Model and CustomModelType to ModelSchema - all existing occurrences of deprecated namings were removed from examples, documentation and platform.

<h4 class="release-note release-note__fixed">FIXED</h4>

* Fixed a couple of issues related to ElasticSearch type collision removal - mainly for related models
* Removed MIT license hardcoded text in Partner Portal
