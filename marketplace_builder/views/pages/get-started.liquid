Welcome to the "Hello World" of platformOS!

These step-by-step tutorials will take you from setting up your development environment to deploying your first platformOS site. After you [get access to the Partner Portal](/get-started/accessing-partner-portal), following and finishing the tutorials in this section should take less than half an hour. 

1. [Set up your first site](/get-started/setting-up-site) through the Partner Portal. 
2. Install NPM based on our tutorials for [Mac](/get-started/installing-npm-mac) and [Windows](/get-started/installing-npm-windows). 
3. [Install the Marketplace Kit](/get-started/installing-marketplace-kit), our CLI tool for deploying your site and communicating with the platformOS API. If you already have the Marketplace Kit installed, don't forget to [update it](/get-started/updating-marketplace-kit). 
4. [Create your platformOS codebase](/get-started/creating-codebase) on your local machine. This is where you'll be doing all the coding. 
5. Change something on the home page and [deploy your first platformOS site](/get-started/deploying-syncing-changes). 


Each step includes tips for learning more: recommendations for further reading, links to our glossary and to in-depth explanations of concepts you might not be familiar with.
