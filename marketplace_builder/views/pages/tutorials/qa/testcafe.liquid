**[TestCafe](https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe)** is an open-source, Node.JS-based end-to-end testing framework for web apps. 

## End-to-end testing

**End-to-end testing** is a technique used to test whether the flow of an application right from start to finish is behaving as expected. The purpose of performing end-to-end testing is to identify system dependencies and to ensure that the data integrity is maintained between various system components and systems.

Together with unit and integration tests, end-to-end tests play an important role in  your quality assurance process, and can help you confirm that the application works as expected.

## Why TestCaf√©?

Unlike other solutions, TestCafe is not built on Selenium, which allows it to provide features that are not available in Selenium-based tools (for example, testing on mobile devices, user roles, automatic waiting, etc.). As it doesn't use WebDriver to work with browsers, it only requires a minimal testing environment and is installed with a single command. 

TestCafe runs on Windows, MacOS, and Linux, and supports desktop, mobile, remote and cloud browsers (UI or headless). See a list of supported browsers [here](https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/documentation/using-testcafe/common-concepts/browsers/browser-support.html).
