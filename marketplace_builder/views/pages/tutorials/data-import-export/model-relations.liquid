With `properties`, you can create your custom fields for storing the data. In the properties, you can also store the `id` of an existing object. Then you can fetch the data with `model(join_on_property: String!)` or the `user(join_on_property: String!)` field in GraphQL.

In order to export/import data with relations preserved, you need to define them in model schema files using the `belongs_to` attribute.
