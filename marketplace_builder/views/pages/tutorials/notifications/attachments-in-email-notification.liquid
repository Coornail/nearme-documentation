This guide will help you attach files to an email notification.

## Requirements
To follow the steps in this tutorial, you should understand the concept of email notifications. You'll use the email notification you created in a previous tutorial.

* [Email Notifications](/tutorials/notifications/creating-email-notification)

## Steps

Attaching file to an email notification is a one-step process:

<div data-autosteps></div>

### Step 1: Include `attachments` JSON in email notification

Add `attachments` JSON to the email notifcation `notifications/email_notifications/welcome_user.liquid` created in a previous step:

```liquid
{% raw %}
---
name: welcome_user
to: '{{ form.email }}'
enabled: true
trigger_condition: true
from: 'Example Marketplace <info@example.com>'
reply_to: no-reply@example.com
subject: 'Welcome {{ form.first_name }} in our marketplace!'
layout_path: mailer
attachments: >
  "logo.jpg": {
    "url": "https://uploads.prod01.oregon.platform-os.com/instances/1/assets/images/svg/platformos-logo.svg"
  }
}
---
<h1>Hi {{ form.first_name }}!</h1>

<p>Welcome in our marketplace!</p>
{% endraw %}
```

Now, when you send an email, the attachment will be included.

You can use `liquid` in the `attachments` field, as long as it evaluates to valid JSON. The expected JSON is in a format:

```json
{
 "<file_name_user_will_see1>": {
   "url": "<url to the attachment>"
 },
 "<file_name_user_will_see2>": {
   "url": "<another url to the attachment>"
 }
}
```

You can also mark any attachment `inline`:

```json
{
 "my_file": {
   "url": "<url to the attachment>",
   "inline": "true"
 }
```

{% include "alert/note", content: "You can include up to 9 attachments and the total size cannot exceed 20MB." %

## Next steps

Congratulations! You have sent email notification with attachment. Now you can learn about creating an SMS notification.
