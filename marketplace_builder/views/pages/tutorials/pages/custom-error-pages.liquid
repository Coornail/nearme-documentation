Instead of returning standard error pages, you can set up **custom error pages** that match your site's design and include information you'd like to convey to your users (e.g. helpful content, relevant links, encouragement to search or browse further). 

You can customize the following error pages: 

* 403
* 404 
* 500 
* 503 

To  customize an error page, [create a Page](/tutorials/pages/creating-page) with the slug equal to the status code.

## 403 - Forbidden

This error page is solely used for a [violated Authorization Policy](/tutorials/authorization-policy/handling-violated-authorization-policy). To customize it, set the slug to 403:

```yaml
---
slug: 403
---
```
```liquid
You do not have access.
```

## 404 - Not Found

This error page is rendered in multiple scenarios. Most commonly, it is rendered when you try to access or modify an object that does not exist. You can also set an Authorization Policy's `http_status` to 404 to force render this page instead of the default 403. To customize it, set the slug to 404:

```yaml
---
slug: 404
---
```
```liquid
The resource you were looking for does not exist.
```

## 500 - Server Error

If there is an error that cannot be handled gracefully, a server error page is displayed. To customize it, set the slug to 500:

```yaml
---
slug: 500
---
```
```liquid
Something went wrong. We will fix the issue as soon as possible.
```

## 503 - Maintenance

You can [enable maintenance mode through the Partner Portal](/tutorials/partner-portal/updating-instance-configuration) (see `maintenance_mode` attribute). To customize it, set the slug to 503:

```yaml
---
slug: 503
---
```
```liquid
The service is temporarily down due to the maintenance. Please check in soon.
```
