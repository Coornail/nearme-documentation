## Liquid filters in platformOS

In platformOS you can use all standard Liquid filters:

* [Official Liquid Documentation](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/)
* [List of standard Liquid filters](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers#standard-filters)

Besides standard Liquid filters, you can also use custom Liquid filters we added.
